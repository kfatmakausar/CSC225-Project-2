    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <div>
      <b>Building Performance Lab</b> <br />
      My internship at Building Performance Lab consists of a research project
      intended to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from buildings in New York
      City. Throughout this internship I have played many distinct roles such as
      the role of Product Manager and Data Scientist. As a a Product Manager, I
      have worked to display demos to the team for new emerging technology that
      our team would be using and help everyone grasp a better understanding of
      why and when this technology would be used. As a Data Scientist, I have
      worked with Python to manage building data from Building Performance Lab's
      datasets. I have also worked to develop data structures and databases for
      large data sets. I have done research and collected public datasets
      related to energy features of NYC buildings and implemented methods for
      translating electronic building records into datasets to warehouse and
      analyze. I have done research and developed BAS standards to help analyze
      and predict energy consumption and carbon emissions. My team and I also
      use regression models and whole facility energy models to evaluate actual
      and predicted energy consumption. This includes using tools like USDOE
      Asset Score, EPA Portfolio Manager, OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, and custom
      analysis models developed by Building Performance Lab.

      <b>Major League Hacking</b> <br />
      My internship with Major League Hacking consisted of contributing to Open
      Source projects in an individual and team-directed setting to add new
      features and debug issues using Git/GitHub and Ubuntu. I worked to design
      and implement new features for an Open Source web app using frameworks
      such as Ruby on Rails and React to improve user experience. I learned and
      mastered new technologies such as Ruby on Rails and Unix in a
      self-directed setting through online resources and under the guidance of a
      professional mentor.
