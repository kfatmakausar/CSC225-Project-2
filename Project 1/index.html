    <h1>Hey! I'm Fatma.</h1>

    <div>
      I am a junior at the CUNY College of Staten Island.<br />
      I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. <br />
      I aspire to be a Software Engineer when I graduate in December of 2020.
      <br />
      Throughout my college experience, I have interned at Major League Hacking
      and at Building Performance Lab.
      <br />
      Industry experience is very important to me. <br />
      Throughout my college experience I have prioritized gaining hands-on
      experience as a Software Engineer and exploring other roles <br />such as
      that of a Product Manager and Data Scientist.
